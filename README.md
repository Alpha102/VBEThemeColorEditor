# VBEThemeColorEditor
The VBA / VB editor (or VBE) is limited in the 16 colors it can use to render code text. This application replaces the default colors with custom palettes that can be saved and loaded.

This application replaces the default colors with custom palettes that can be saved and loaded (2 themes are already provided).
The application can only run in administrator mode!

How to use:
* Open the app and edit the color palette to your liking. You can save and load palettes too (via the "Theme" menu).
* Click on "Apply theme to VBE.DLL". You will then have to select the VBE6.DLL or VBE7.DLL file depending on your Excel version. The original file will be automatically backed up in its folder.
* That's it, you have replaced the original VBE color palette with a custom one. You can now adjust your settings directly in the VBA editor (Tools > Options > Editor Format).
